# Ridesharing App with AI and ML Predictions

This project is a ridesharing application similar to Uber and Lyft, enhanced with AI and ML capabilities to predict rider demand fluctuations and estimate arrival times (ETAs). The application provides a seamless experience for users, drivers, and administrators, utilizing advanced technologies to optimize the ride-sharing process.

## Project Overview

The ridesharing app leverages Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) algorithms to analyze historical data and real-time factors, predicting changes in rider demand and estimating accurate ETAs for rides. By integrating these predictive capabilities, the app aims to improve efficiency, reduce wait times, and enhance overall user satisfaction.

7. **Design Model Class Diagram**: Detailed class diagram representing the design model of the application.

8. **Documentation and Class Diagrams for Design Patterns Used**: Explanation of design patterns implemented in the project and associated class diagrams.

## Backend

The backend of the application is responsible for handling business logic, data processing, and communication with external services.

### Running the Backend

To run the backend in development mode:

1. Ensure you have all required packages installed by running `yarn`.
2. Start the backend server using `yarn dev`.

## Frontend

The frontend of the application provides the user interface for interacting with the ridesharing platform.

### Running the Frontend

To run the frontend in development mode:

1. Ensure you have all required packages installed by running `yarn`.
2. Start the frontend development server using `yarn dev`.

### Important Notes

- For Google login, Firebase authentication must be activated.
- Google Maps API service from Google Cloud Platform (GCP) must be activated to enable location services.
